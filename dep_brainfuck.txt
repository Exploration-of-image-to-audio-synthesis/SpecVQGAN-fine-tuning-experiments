a lot of shit had to be done, but it's pretty straightforward luckily

the conda_env file doesn't work at all and all attempts to fix it failed
i had to build stuff the good old way and install packages when needed. this almost worked, but then i ran into some difficulties with versions. i'm mostly fixing everything using the most straightforward methods (just installing different versions that were in the original conda env file)

when running with error with numpy, i tried downgrading it and then fixing the packages. this didn't work because packages kept installing the latest numpy version. so i instead installed additional packages first, and then downgraded numpy

i got it workinig. the updated conda config is in the conda_env_win.yaml file
